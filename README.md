Did you ever have a weird color format that you wanted to convert or share it with your friend? Well, now you can... Just visit this site and share your color in an instant. [Site Link](https://fschatbot.github.io/Color-Share/)

## Inspiration

Well, sometimes I just wanted to view a color in full-screen mode so I made a site that allows you to share color information in an instant and allows you to see it in full-screen

## How to build

Just run the following commands

```
git clone fschatbot/Color-Share
cd Color-Share
npm clean-install --no-audit --no-fund
npm run build
```

Now you just need to double-click the index.html file to open the site or you can serve it with a local server.

PS: There is no need to do this and instead you should just use the [site link](https://fschatbot.github.io/Color-Share/).
